-- DDL: index build, REINDEX, CLUSTER
-- Operation: reindex_medium
-- REINDEX an existing btree (100k): rebuild it from scratch.
-- Isolated write: runs only on the scratch DB (tpch_write). Everything above
-- the marker line is SETUP - it rebuilds a disposable w_* table from read-only
-- reference data and is NOT timed. write_runner then quiesces the scratch tables,
-- drops caches and restarts the cluster, so only the statement below the marker
-- is measured, always from a cold start.
